## Installation

1. Install uv if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Build the app:
   ```bash
   python3 build_app.py
   ```

3. Open the app:
   ```bash
   open "Usage Inspector.app"
   ```

## Setup

On first launch, click the menu bar icon and select "Set OAuth Token..." to enter your Claude Code OAuth token (generated by `claude setup-token`).
